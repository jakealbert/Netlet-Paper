This article provides an overview of {Jabber/XMPP} protocols and technologies, as well as an introduction to {XMPP}-based applications.},

While XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for exchanging XML data, it is used mainly for the purpose of building instant messaging and presence applications that meet the requirements of RFC 2779.}
