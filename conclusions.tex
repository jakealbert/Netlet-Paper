\section{Conclusions}
This project illustrated the absolute importance of maintaining proper development and testing environments.  From day one, everything should have been in version control, and not doing this proved disasterous.\\

Additionally, \netlets provided valuable lessons regarding circuit layout, construction, and prototyping.  First of all, though the \dxd/\pads suite is feature-full and professional in quality, not using component libaries proved to be our downfall.  Though free software suites may note provide \dxd 's feature set, the libraries of correct footprints may have been worth it.\\

We learned that there is no such thing as ordering too many spare parts.  Whether it was having the right gauge wire, having headers with the right pin count, or having the same model relay, problems stemmed from not being careful with our component choices and not strictly checking our product orders.\\

\netlets also imparted on us that an engineering prototype should not aim to be a market-killer, should not try to undercut and out-feature the competition, and should be resourceful until successful.  A group should not worry about finding the cheapest parts until they are convinced their methods are sound.\\
