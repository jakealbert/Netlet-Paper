\subsubsection{Price and Target Audience}
\\ Achieving an acceptable price point for \netlets has remained a primary consideration throughout the design process. We consider our target market to be the entire market for power strips. Achieving this degree of market penetration might seem unrealistic, but an analysis of the market for power strips in contrast to the analogous market for lightbulbs shows this is not the case.

\\ The market for smart and non-smart power strips is dominated by conventional non-smart products with extremely low design, materials, and manufacturing labor costs. They come with the hidden cost of wasteful (because unmonitored) power consumption. Smart power strips, as we have discussed, are situated on the far opposite end of the price spectrum. They come with the benefit associated with monitored power consumption. The essential problem \netlets try to solve is the filling of this gap with a piece of smart power-monitoring and -controlling infrastructure inexpensive enough to compete with cheap non-smart power strips and to thereby achieve their market penetration.

\\ Like non-smart power strips, incandescent lightbulbs have extremely low design complexity, material cost, and manufacturing cost. They also have a hidden expense associated with inefficient use of power. On the other hand industrial and commercial florescent lightbulb assemblies offered institutional customers who could afford more complicated and expensive fixtures great savings because bulbs lasted longer and used less energy. The process that led to massive adoption of compact florescent lightbulbs hinged on the design of an inexpensive but intelligent assembly that adapted existing incandescent fixtures to support energy-efficient florescent tubes. Innovative technology, combined with government subsidies, drove the price of compact florescent bulbs to a level competitive with incandescent bulbs. While government subsidies for green technology will only become a consideration at the end of the design cycle, we are confident that smart decisions taken with an understanding of the cutting edge of embedded and network technologies will enable the design of a product as economical as a compact florescent lightbulb and with as positive an impact on power consumption.
